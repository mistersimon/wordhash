# WordHash

WordHash creates a human-readable hash designed for uuids but can handle other strings too.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install wordhash.

```bash
npm install wordhash
```

## Usage

```js
var WordHash = require('wordhash');

var wordHash = WordHash();

const input = "0073baeb-c5dc-48a5-bcf7-b35f9d7a36fd";

wordHash.hash(input);
//  "video-sad-carolina-twenty"

wordHash.hash("d13175d4-bee9-4e80-b24c-89c15c126cbf");
//  "massachusetts-social-apart-robert"
  
WordHash({ salt: 'saltySalt'}).hash(input)
//  "skylark-bakerloo-low-early"

WordHash({ length: '3'}).hash(input)
//  "video-sad-carolina"

WordHash({ separator: '~'}).hash(input)
//  "video~sad~carolina~twenty"

WordHash({ separator: null }).hash(input)
//  ["video", "sad", "carolina", "twenty"]
```

See [test.js](./test.js) for usage more examples

## Caveats
WordHash conversions are one way, and are not as 'unique' as uuids meaning its more likely to be collisions. With default settings its statistical uniqueness is only around 1 in 4.3 billion. 

## How It Works
Each word is generated by mapping a segment of the input to a word in the wordlist. Segments are taken from the start of the md5 hash of the string and salt.

This algorithm is deterministic, so the same input and wordlist will always produce the same output. 


## Inspiration

* [humanhash][]: Great library and wordset but does not support salting and wordlist is fixed to 256 words
* [hashwords][]: Good implimentation of salting and variable length wordlist
